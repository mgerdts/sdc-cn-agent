# sdc-cn-agent

**This branch is used for the port of cn-agent to Linux.  It is not complete.**

This is a branch PR test.

This repository is part of the Joyent Triton project. See the [contribution
guidelines](https://github.com/joyent/triton/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) --
*Triton does not use GitHub PRs* -- and general documentation at the main
[Triton project](https://github.com/joyent/triton) page.

sdc-cn-agent is an RPC mechanism via which a client can interact with a
compute node. It acts as an externally visible interface to subsystems within
the server. 

It is responsible for executing "tasks", scripts which break down some
unit of work into a number of steps to be completed.  This may range
from creating a virtual machine to something as simple as creating or listing
ZFS datasets.


# Repository

Some notable parts of the repo:

XXX this is bogus!

    node_modules/fw         This is a copy of smartos-live.git:src/fw
                            and should be kept in sync. It is used to
                            provide a node API to `fw.{update,del,add}`
                            for firewall data.


# Development

To run the cn-agent:

    git clone git@github.com:joyent/sdc-cn-agent.git
    cd sdc-cn-agent
    git submodule update --init

## Linux port

To build, you need node 6, as this requires lockfd, which has not yet been
updated for node 8+.

```
$ curl https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.17.1/node-v6.17.1-linux-x64.tar.gz | sudo tar xzf - -C /opt
$ PATH=/opt/node-v6.17.1-linux-x64/bin:$PATH make
```

The plan:

- Initially no support for:
  - Docker
  - Snapshots
  - Migration
- Explore the use of [node-libvirt](https://github.com/hooklift/node-libvirt) to
  implement the required tasks.

### Example: sysinfo

In the SmartOS version, sysinfo is a bash script that processes text.  Various
Linux tools are happy to print configuration in JSON, implying bash is the wrong
tool.  The following script can be used to see sysinfo output:

```
#! /usr/node/bin/node

sysinfo = require('/__FIXME__/sdc-cn-agent/lib/backends/linux/sysinfo');

// If there is an error, it is probably a MultiError (see VError module).
// If you run this without root privs, dmidecode will fail but everything else
// should succed.  When cn-agent runs calls sysInfo(), it fails if any errors
// are returned.
sysinfo.sysInfo(null, function (err, info) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(info, null, 2))
});
```

### Example API call with curl

The following illustrates how to call the `image_get` task for the image with
the specified uuid.  The `ip` is the admin IP listed in sysinfo.

```
#! /bin/bash

ip=a.b.c.d
json='{
  "task": "image_get",
  "params": {
    "uuid": "63d6e664-3f1f-11e8-aef6-a3120cf8dd9d"
  }
}'

curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -d "$json" http://$ip/tasks
```
